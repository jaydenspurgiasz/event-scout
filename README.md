# Event Scout

Introducing Event Scout, a social media style event hub where anyone can post, find, RSVP to events near them. Event organizers post event flyers and details, attendees create an account and sign up or save certain events. The events are automatically synced with the user’s calendar to push notifications before the event. Each event contains its own “group chat” where attendees can meet online beforehand.
